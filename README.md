_A Hyprland shell made of bacon._

## What

My idea for now is to make a `quickshell` port of my `waybar`, but Iâ€™ve already
replaced `hyprpaper` with it and plan to do the same with `mako`. Not sure yet
about `rofi`.

Currently, it works only on Hyprland, but I might add support for Niri in the
future.
